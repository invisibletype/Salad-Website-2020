              <p class="content">The world of cryptomining can daunt newcomers, after all — those of us with hardware capable of mining have invested a lot of time, money, and love into our rigs, and wouldn’t dare risk our PC’s health for anything, even extra income. Our mission at Salad is to demystify and simplify mining for would-be adopters. We see crypto as critical to web 3.0, and we think we can help jump start the generation of users who make a decentralized internet possible.</p>
              <p class="content">With all the rumors swirling about scams, hardware degradation, and profitability (or the lack thereof), we wanted to clear the waters and make a definitive guide to the impact mining has on your PC, from electricity costs to wear and tear. That way on-the-fence miners can make an informed decision about whether to jump in the blockchain headfirst or stick to the sidelines.</p>
              <h2 class="title is-size-4 is-wide is-spaced">Will Mining Damage, Degrade, Or Otherwise Harm My PC?</h2>
              <p class="content">This is where most potential adopters get stuck. A lot of ink has been spilled on the subject, and misunderstandings abound. Luckily, there’s tons of great resources from level-headed figures in the tech space, plus this handy-dandy article I wrote a couple of months ago.</p>

              <p class="content">To eliminate bias, I’m only going to reference third-party content from relatively objective content creators — meaning, people with no vested interest in mining. If you’re looking for a short answer, here’s the TL;DR: mining is not a danger to your hardware if you do it properly. We’ll delve into the whys and hows of that statement below.</p>
              <p class="content">There’s nothing better than hard evidence, and thankfully the past couple years have yielded tons of tests on the impact of long term mining. Since the crypto boom of 2017, hundreds of thousands of consumer GPUs have powered various blockchains, and many have survived to report back to us in 2019. Here’s a few great sources:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <a href="">Does 2 Years of Mining Ruin a Graphics Card?</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a href="">Will Mining Damage My GPU?</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a href="">Gaming or Mining: What Damages a Graphics Card More?</a>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p class="content">While not a perfectly controlled experiment, the first video does a thorough job benchmarking two GPUs: one that mined for two years straight, and another that had only gamed on and off for about the same time period. There proved to be little difference in performance between the two; however, the person who set up the mining card knew what they were doing.</p>
